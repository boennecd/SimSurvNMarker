# Examples of Simulating Data Sets
This directory contains scripts to simulate data sets. The examples are

 - [w-all.md](w-all.md) with all components present.
 - [one-marker.md](one-marker.md) with only a univariate marker.
 - [no-gamma.md](no-gamma.md) without gamma (non-time-varying fixed effects in the markers).
 - [no-B.md](no-B.md) without B (time-varying fixed effects in the markers).
 - [no-delta.md](no-delta.md) without delta (fixed effects in the survival model).
 - [w-ids.md](w-ids.md) where the `id` argument is used in the 
   sampling functions.
